        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <br></br>
        <p>My name is Cuthbert Baines and I didn't have a background in Computing before I started my computing course at
        Hallam University in 2021. When I first started the course I didn't know if I was going to be up to the job of
        being a computer programer but i knew I was going to be up for the job. I was always up for having a go at
        anything the course and the University offered me. I was always up for putting the time and effort in and make
        the most of whatever was happening on the course at that time.
