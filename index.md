# Hi — I'm [Cuthbert Baines]
Welcome! This is a small selection of projects and screenshots to give you a rapid sense of the kind of work I produce. Click any card for details, screenshots, or a link to the repo.

Below is a quick highlight list. To add or edit projects, update the `projects` list in this file or create project pages under `projects/` and point the `url` there.

(You can also add a short About section here in Markdown.)
