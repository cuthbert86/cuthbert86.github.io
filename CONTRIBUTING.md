# Please can Cuthbert Baines stop experimenting with a brand new way of deploying this github pages.io site!  
If he can just stick with writting it in just one programming language and only use one html template and one .css file that isn't full to the brim of unused snippets.
Then maybe don't bother trying to get that imperial measurement system conversion thing translated into Javescript to on here because it will need a new workflow that won't work but will definately stop
everything else from working!

Keep it real!
