          <h2>Jerusalem Is Cursed. Blame Baibars</h2>
<p>
I’ve done the historical research and I’ve found out who is really to blame for all the war crimes, terrorism, crimes against humanity and various other bad stuff going on in the “Holy Land”. Basically it’s mainly Baibars fault.  Basically he rose up from a slave soldier to sultan of the mukluk empire and he defeated the kwarezmians who had killled almost everyone in Jerusalerm and then he defeated the Mongols who had been ridiing in and out of it to raid the place (it didn’t have any walls at the time) and then he paid to get the walls rebuilt and he improved the infrastructure across the entire region.  Then he encouraged the Jews and Muslims to return to the city.  At the time he conquered Jerusalam that hell hole only had 2000 inhabitants!  If he just abandoned it then it would just be another ruined city like Jerricho, Persepolis, Old Sarum or Zanadu!  Someone should have told Baibars that there is nothing Holy about the Holy land and redirected him towards Tunisia and Sicily instead, if it wasn’t for Jerusalem both sides would have signed a peace treaty in the 70s (Carter) or the 90s (Clinton). 
Below are extracts from a few wikipedia articles to back up my theory:  
</p>
<p>
“the main effect of the Khwarezmians was to slaughter the local population, especially in Jerusalem. Their Siege of Jerusalem began on July 11, 1244, and the city's citadel, the so-called Tower of David, surrendered on August 23.[15] The Khwarezmians then ruthlessly decimated the population, leaving only 2,000 people, Christians and Muslims, still living in the city.” 
</p>
<p1 class="italic">
  [They should have killed a few more people and finished the job!]
</p1>
<p>
“After having troubles with the Khwarezmians, Sultan as-Salih began ordering armed expeditions to raid Christian communities and capture men, women and children. Called razzias, or by their original Arabic name ghazw (sing.: ghazwa or ghaza), the raids extended into Caucasia, the Black Sea, Byzantium, and the coastal areas of Europe.” 
</p>
<br></br>
<p1 class="italic">
[Slavery can be justified if you are doing it to use those slaves in your slave army to re-conquer a “Holy City” even though the “city” was basically just an empty ruin at the time] 
</p1>
<br></br>
<p>
“The newly enslaved were divided according to category. Women were either turned into maids or sex slaves. The men depending upon age and ability were made into servants or killed. Young boys and girls were sent to imams, where they were indoctrinated into Islam. According to ability the young boys were then made into eunuchs or sent into decades-long training as mamluk (slave soldiers). This army of indoctrinated slaves was forged into a potent armed force. The Sultan then used this new army to eliminate the Khwarezmians, and Jerusalem returned to Ayyubid rule in 1247.” 
</p>
<br></br>
<p1 class="italic">
  [Phew!  At least the capture and enslavement of 10s of thousands of innocent people so he could re-conquer a city of 2000 inhabitants wasn’t a complete waste!] 
</p1>
<br></br>
<p>
“In 1260, a portion of the Mongol army advanced toward Egypt, and was engaged by the Mamluks in Galilee, at the pivotal Battle of Ain Jalut. The Mamluks were victorious, and the Mongols retreated.” 
</p>
<p1 class="italic">
  [The Mongols tried to destroy, undermine, burn or remove the Golden Gate of the Dome of the Rock in 1300 but without success, and when the Mamluks returned, they had the gate walled up” - If they had been successful the world would be a far better place by now!] 
</p1>
<br></br>
<p>
“Mamluk sultans made a point of visiting the city, endowing new buildings, encouraging Muslim settlement, and expanding mosques. During the reign of Sultan Baibars, the Mamluks renewed the Muslim alliance with the Jews and he established two new sanctuaries” 
</p>
<br></br>
 <p>
“In the Old City he established the Ramban Synagogue, the oldest active synagogue in Jerusalem. However, the city had no great political power, and was in fact considered by the Mamluks as a place of exile for out-of-favor officials. The city itself was ruled by a low-ranking emir.” 
 </p> 
<p1 class="italic">
[Believe it or not this isn’t the first time Egyptians citizens helped to rebuild Jerusalem, that fucking city has never produced anything of any real value, so during its entire history it is always scrounging off pilgrims, the Church, Sultans, The Knights Templar/Hospitaller or a deluded crusader,  Richard the Lionheart spent 2 yeard of Englands annual revenues to go there and the same amount again to pay his ransom when he got captured on his way back, then he died 6 months afterwards!]  
</p1>
<br></br>
Jerusalem is cursed, When the First Crusade conquered it they murdered every Muslim or Jew they could find (including women and chilren and then they drank their blood and they used the entire Temple mount as a rubbish dump!   
“The Fatimid takeover was followed by the expulsion of most of the Sunnis, in which many of them were also killed.”
<br></br>
“The Ayyubids destroyed the walls in expectation of ceding the city to the Crusaders as part of a peace treaty. In 1229, by treaty with Egypt's ruler al-Kamil, Jerusalem came into the hands of Frederick II of Germany. In 1239, after a ten-year truce expired, he began to rebuild the walls; these were again demolished by an-Nasir Da'ud, the emir of Kerak, in the same year” 
<br></br>
<p1 class="italic">
[Frederick II Hohenstaufen was the only person who didn’t commit murder, mass murder, kidnap, rape, looting, arson and Slavery just to take Jerusalem and yet he was the only one who was excommunicated throughout that entire crusade!] 
</p1>
<br></br>
<p>
In 37 BC King Herod rebuilt the second temple which was destroyed in 70AD by Emperor Vespasian who then made his son kill and capture as many people as he could: “After the city's fall, the elderly and infirm were killed against Titus's orders,[340] while younger 
 survivors were sorted: rebels executed, the strongest sent to Titus' triumph, those over 17 enslaved or executed across the empire, and children sold into slavery” 
“In Caesarea Philippi, he staged executions, gladiatorial combat, and wild animal killings. For his brother Domitian's birthday, celebrated in Caesarea Maritima, 2,500 captives were slaughtered in similar games.[348][349] More executions followed during Vespasian's birthday in Berytus” 
</p>
<br></br>
<p1 class="italic">
[With the benefit of hindsight Herod shouldn’t have bothered rebuilding that fucking Temple again!] 
</p1>
  <br></br>
<p>
Rameses the Great also sacked Jerusalem as well! 
</p>
<br></br>
<p>
Louis Napoleon III wanted the title “protector of the Christian pilgrims in Jerusalem” so he invaded Russia to get it, yes the Crimean war was started because of Jerusalem! 
</p>
<br></br>
<p>
In 597 BC the Babylonians deported 25% of the residents of Jerusalem in what became known as the Babylonian captivity and then they destroyed the place while they were there, it remained in ruins for approximately 150 years. 
</p>
  <br></br>
<p>
Whenever the medieval Feudal despots from Western sent a crusading army that retook Jerusalem they would re-built the city walls which were immediately destroyed by the Arabs everytime they regaied control of the city.
