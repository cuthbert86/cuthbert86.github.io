    <p>My name is Cuthbert Baines, I have recently completed my degree in computing at Sheffield Hallam University.  
        I specialised in smart computing (Internet of things) but I've done a little bit of everything so I understand
        all the major computing concepts however I never became an expert in any single computing language or framework. 
        I mainly worked with the various Python based computing languages.  I Python for data analysis, web-development 
        (Django), collecting data with my Raspberry Pi, sending data via MQTT and the Micropython/Circuit Pytion variants
        while working with my raspberry pi picos. 

        I've also worked with data bases, AI, Web technologies, Node-Red, bash scripts and C#.  I will try to show examples
        of my work on these web-pages.

        I am currently looking forward to getting a proper job somewhere in the IT sector. I'm open minded about what kind
        of job I do in the IT sector.
