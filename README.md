My name is Cuthbert Baines, I have recently completed my degree in computing at Sheffield Hallam University.  
I specialised in smart computing (Internet of things) but I've done a little bit of everything so I understand
all the major computing concepts however I never became an expert in any single computing language or framework. 
I mainly worked with the various Python based computing languages.  I Python for data analysis, web-development 
(Django), collecting data with my Raspberry Pi, sending data via MQTT and the Micropython/Circuit Pytion variants
while working with my raspberry pi picos.
