Anything Design based is difficult for me because of one of my personal limitations.  "Cuthbert doesn't appreciate aesthetics".  
So this won't be the prettiest example of a github pages.io website but I'm going to use this as practice and try to show off some
of my best work for my fellow software engineers and potential employers.
